####The app uses the following depencencies
To get more familiar with the techniques we are using in this project please see the following websites.
+ angular-ui-router (ui.router) https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router
  - Used instead of ng-route for routing using states
+ restangular (restangular) https://github.com/mgonto/restangular
  - For rest communication with the DHIS2 web api.
+ angular-translate (pascalprecht.translate) https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate
  - For i18n support
+ angular-bootstrap (ui.bootstrap) https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap
+ angular-ui-select (ui.select) https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select

##Getting started

### How to get started

#####Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/dhis2/user-management-pepfar.git
```

#####Install the node dependencies
```
npm install
```

#####Install the bower app dependencies
```
bower install
```

#####Run the tests
```
gulp test
```

###Running tests continuously
To run the tests continuously while making changes to the app files or the jasmine spec files use the following gulp task.
```
gulp watch
```

###Building the project
The gulp file contains two different build tasks `build` and `build-prod`.
`build` builds the project into the build directory within the root of the project. `build-prod` does exactly the same but also zips the contents of the build folder into a zip file called `user-maintenance.zip`. This zipfile can be used to install the app into DHIS2. 

####Installing the app into DHIS
How to install the app into dhis can be found at the following url https://www.dhis2.org/doc/snapshot/en/developer/html/ch02s04.html.

### Additional info on the project structure
The project directory stucture is set up as follows. See below the tree for some more detailed information.
```
+ src
  - {component-name}                    // Component based structure for each part of the application a different map
    + {partial}.html
    + {component-name}-controller.js    // Controllers are suffixed with `-controller`  
    + {service-name}-service.js         // Services are suffixed with `-service`  
    + {directive-name}-directive.js     // Directives are suffixed with `-directive`  
  - i18n                                // i18n map that contains the translation files used by angular-translate
    + en.json
  - images                              // Place to store images
    + icons
      + user-maintenance.png
  - index.html                          // Main index file of the app
  - manifest.webapp                     // Webapp manifest, see below for more details
+ test
  - matchers                            // Folder to store jasmine matchers
  - mocks                               // Folder to store test mocks
    + {mock-name}_mock.js               // Mock files are suffixed with `_mock`
  - specs                               
    + {component-name}                  // Specs are groupped by the component they belong to
      + {component-name}-controller_spec.js // The spec files represent the names as used in the component but 
      + {service-name}-service_spec.js      // are suffixed with `_spec`
      + {directive-name}-directive_spec.js
  - utils                               // Files that do not fit the specs/mocks or matchers category
+ vendor                                // Place where bower stores its components
+ build                                 // The place where the project gets build when calling `gulp build` or `gulp build-prod`
```
In the main directory you will find a folder `src`. This folder contains all the source files that will be used in the app. This folder will contain all the angular components likes services / directives / controllers etc.

The `test` folder within the main directory contains all the test related files. The specs are located within the `test/specs` directory. 

##### Some special things
The `manifest.webapp` might not look familiar. This is a mozilla open web app manifest. This manifest file is used to install the app into DHIS2. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Intro_to_open_web_apps  and https://www.dhis2.org/doc/snapshot/en/developer/html/ch02s02.html for more information.

The following directories might show up in the root of the project. The short explanation should give some insight into why this would have happened.
+ temp
  - Directory used by sass and usemin to store the temporary sass output
+ coverage
  - Directory used by coveralls to store the test coverage output from karma
+ .sass-cache
  - Directory used by sass to store cashed sass output
